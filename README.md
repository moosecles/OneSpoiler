# OneSpoiler
A python Reddit bot that will provide the user with the latest spoilers for One Piece. Every Thursday, spoilers for the latest chapter are uploaded to Reddit, this bot retreives it and displays it.
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Reddit API, PRAW module, and more to come.

The OneSpoiler Reddit bot script uses the Reddit API to retrieve the latest chapter spoilers for One Piece.

It first checks to see whether you ran the program before (as the latest chapter number will be stored in a file called chapter.txt.)

It then shows the pages (text), in a organized manner, for the latest chapter spoilers.

As the bot is still in development more features will be added. Eventually I want to expand it so it will have a interactive GUI that you can use to see the spoilers clearly and even get a link to the latest chapter.
