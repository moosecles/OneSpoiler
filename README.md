# OneSpoiler
A python Reddit bot that will provide the user with the latest spoilers for One Piece. Every Thursday, spoilers for the latest chapter are uploaded to Reddit, this bot retreives it and displays it.
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Reddit API, PRAW module, Tkinter, and more to come.

The OneSpoiler Reddit bot script uses the Reddit API to retrieve the latest chapter spoilers for One Piece.

It first checks to see whether you ran the program before (as the latest chapter number will be stored in a file called chapter.txt.)

It then shows the pages (text), in a organized manner, for the latest chapter spoilers.

As the bot is still in development more features will be added. I have a basic GUI but I want to add more functionality such as the option to switch between chapters and eventually get the latest chapter for you to read.
